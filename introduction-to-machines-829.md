Machines are the heart of MAAS. They are the backbone of your data centre application(s), providing the functions that are relevant to your customers. MAAS manages their transit through a life-cycle, from adding and enlistment, through commissioning, allocation, and deployment, finally being released back to the pool, or retired altogether.  You can move them around, create redundant versions (even in other geographies you can access), and basically rearrange them to the extent that your network allows.

For example, in the illustration below, you see a typical small hospital data centre, including servers ready and allocated for functions like Pharmacy, Orders, Charts, and so on:

These example machines would typically be duplicated in several different geographies, with a quick way to switch to a redundant node, should anything go wrong (e.g., high availability).  We used the word node there because, In the network language of MAAS, machines are one of several different types of nodes.  A node is simply a network-connected object or, more specifically, an object that can independently communicate on a network. MAAS nodes include controllers, network devices, and of course, machines.   

Looking back at the example above, you can see that there are several columns in the machine list:

<!-- vanilla
![machine-list-columns|690x105](../images/e6339dd1439b3b54be7a75f7239d1981754a07f6_2_690x105.jpeg)

 ui -->

<!-- cli
### ADD SUITABLE CLI EXAMPLE OR PRINTOUT ###
 cli -->

The columns list the following details for each machine:

-   **FQDN | MAC**: The fully qualified domain name or the MAC address of the machine.
-   **Power**: 'On', 'Off' or 'Error' to highlight an error state.
-   **Status**: The current status of the machine, such as 'Ready', 'Commissioning' or 'Failed testing'.
-   **Owner**: The MAAS account responsible for the machine.
-   **Cores**: The number of CPU cores detected on the machine.
-   **RAM**: The amount of RAM, in GiB, discovered on the machine.
-   **Disks**: The number of drives detected on the machine.
-   **Storage**: The amount of storage, in GB, identified on the machine.

<h2 id="heading--machine-life-cycle">Machine life-cycle</h2>

One of the most important things to understand about machines is their life-cycle.  Machines can be disovered or added, commissioned by MAAS, acquired, deployed, released, marked broken, tested, put into rescue mode, and deleted.  In addition, pools, zones, and tags can be set for machines.

All of these states and actions represent the possible life-cycle of a machine.  This life-cycle isn't strict or linear -- it depends on how you use a machine -- but it's useful to give a general overview of how machines tend to change states.  In the discussion that follows, states and actions are shown in **bold** type.

* Machines start as servers in your environment, attached to a network or subnet MAAS can manage.

* If machines are configured to netboot, MAAS can **discover** them and present them to you for possible commissioning, changing their state to **New**.

* When you select a machine that is marked **New**, you can choose to **commission** it.  If you add a machine manually, it is automatically **commissioned**.

* Machines that have successfully commissioned can be **acquired** and **deployed**.  Machines that don't successfully commission can be **marked broken** (and later recovered when the issues are resolved).

* Resolving problems with machines usually involve **testing** the machine.

* Once you've deployed a machine, and you're done with it, you can **release** it.

* You can place a machine in **rescue mode**, which allows you to SSH to a machine to make configuration changes or do other maintenance. Once you're done, you can **exit rescue mode***.

* Any time a machine is on, you have the option to select it and **power off** that machine.

* You can **abort** any operation that's in progress.

* You also have the option to set tags, availiabity zone, or resource pool at various stages along the way.

Since these actions are not necessarily sequential, and the available actions change as the machine state changes, it's not very useful to make a state diagram or flowchart.  Instead, consider the following table:

| Action/State | New | Ready | Acquired | Deployed | Locked | Rescue | Broken |
|--------------|:---:|:-----:|:--------:|:--------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| Commission   | X   | X     |          |          |        |        |   X    |

| Unlock       |     |       |          |          |   X    |        |        |
| Tag          | X   | X     |   X      |    X     |        |   X    |   X    |
| Set zone     | X   | X     |   X      |    X     |        |   X    |   X    |

| Delete       | X   | X     |   X      |    X     |        |   X    |   X    |

When a machine is in the state listed in a column, it is possible to take the row actions marked with an "X."  You access these actions from the "Take action" menu in the upper right corner of the machine listing.  Note that some actions, such as "Mark broken" or "Lock," may be hidden when they are not available.

<h2 id="heading--machine-list">View the machine list</h2>

Incidentally, you can get to this list of machines from the choice "Machines" on the top menu of the MAAS web UI.  This action will display a table like the one above, listing all the machines that are currently visible to your MAAS installation.  During commissioning and deployment, MAAS updates the table to reflect the changing state of each machine. These values are augmented with green, amber and red icons to represent successful, in-progress and failed transitions, respectively. The MAAS web UI employs similar icons and colours throughout the interface to reflect a machine's status.

Rolling the cursor over status icons often reveals more details. For example, a failed hardware test script will place a warning icon alongside the hardware type tested by the script. Rolling the cursor over this will reveal which test failed.  Likewise, you can find some immediate options by rolling over the column data items in the machines table.

Here are some details on what this card presents, with details on in-card links described in following sections:
 - **OVERVIEW** the machine status (in this case "Deployed"), and lists OS version information.  
 - **CPU** shows the specifics of the CPU(s), including a link to test the processor(s).
 - **MEMORY** gives the total available RAM for this machine, along with a test link.
 - **STORAGE** presents the total amount of storage available and the number of disks that provide that storage.  There are two links here: one gives the storage layout (with the opportunity to change it for devices that are in 'Ready' or 'Allocated' states.
 - **Owner** identifies the owner of the machine.
 - **Domain** indicates the domain in which the machine exists.
 - **Zone** shows the AZ in which this machine resides, along with a link to edit the machine configuration (to change the AZ, if desired).
 - **Resource pool** shows the pool to which this machine has been assigned, and an edit link.
 - **Power type** gives the current power type, which links to the relevant edit form.
 - **Tags** presents the list of tags associated with this machine, editable via the link.

Note that clicking any of the links in this card will either present a pop-up form or take you to another item in the machine menu -- so using the browser "back" button will take you completely away from this machine's page.  For example, you can choose the "Test CPU" option, which brings up this overlay:

 ui -->

<!-- cli
### ADD SUITABLE CLI EXAMPLE OR PRINTOUT ###
 cli -->

There are two sections to this tab.  The "Machine configuration" section offers some general parameters, mostly related to how this machine is grouped and categorised.  More information on these options are found in the relevant sections of the documentation (e.g., tags, resource pools, and so forth). 

The "Power configuration" supplies the parameters necessary for MAAS to access the machine to PXE-boot it. Note that this machine failed testing.  Editing the "Power configuration" section gives us a clue as to what might be wrong:

After entering the correct password and recycling things, the problem goes away:

 ui -->

<!-- cli

More information on Power configuration will be found in the [Power management](https://maas.io/docs/bmc-power-types) section of this documentation.
