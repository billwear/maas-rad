Usage: xpub push discourse [OPTIONS] [FILES]...

  Push files to a discourse forum from the CWD

  Files must represent topics that already exist, and should be named
  "<anything-you-want>-tnum.md", where "tnum" is the topic number.  Nothing
  other than the "tnum" affects anything about the pushed topic. You may
  specify files with wildcards, if desired.

  Tags are markers that turn on commented-out sections of the markdown, so
  that you can create different versions of the topic.  To add a tag, simply
  place a comment before the paragraph you wish to make conditional, like
  this: "<!-- keyword" and place a corresponding comment marker after the
  paragraph, like this: "keyword -->".  Enter a tag keyword, exactly as
  specified, when you invoke this command.

  Only one tag per push.  This may seem like a limitation, but if you are
  using mutliple dimensions (like CLI vs. UI, and version 2 vs. version 3,
  you'll quickly discover that nested tags don't work well for writing.
  Instead, try tags like "v2-cli" or "v3-ui".

  You must have URL and auth data in a file called "/etc/dc.yaml" -- see the
  example file in github for details.

Options:
  -t TEXT  document tag to control output
  --help   Show this message and exit.
