about-maas-840.md:MAAS can act as a standalone PXE/preseed service or integrate with other technologies. It works exceptionally well with [Juju](https://jaas.ai/docs/maas-cloud), the service and model management tool. MAAS manages the machines and Juju manages the services running on those machines -- a perfect arrangement.  Virtual machines (VMs) can even act as MAAS machines if they boot from the network via PXE.
about-maas-840.md:MAAS works with any system configuration tools. Both the [Chef](https://www.chef.io/chef) and [Juju](https://jaas.ai/) teams recommend MAAS as a physical provisioning system.
about-maas-840.md:Please note that Windows and RHEL images require [Ubuntu Advantage](https://www.ubuntu.com/support) to work correctly with MAAS.

api-authentication-742.md:MAAS's API uses [OAuth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth) as its authentication mechanism. This isn't third-party (3-legged) OAuth, so the process used is what's commonly referred to as 0-legged OAuth: the consumer accesses protected resources by submitting OAuth signed requests.

commission-machines-822.md:A bond interface is used to aggregate two or more physical interfaces into a single logical interface. Combining multiple network connections in parallel can increase network throughput beyond what a single NIC will allow.  It also provides some redundancy in case one of the NICs should fail.  More information about the theory behind bonded NICs is found in the [relevant IEEE standard](https://1.ieee802.org/tsn/802-1ax-rev/).

creating-a-custom-ubuntu-image-1652.md:MAAS supports deploying custom DD or TGZ images. Canonical provides both [lp:maas-image-builder](https://launchpad.net/maas-image-builder) and [gh:canonical/packer-maas](https://github.com/canonical/packer-maas) to support creating custom images however these tools do not currently support Ubuntu. Instead Canonical suggests customizing Ubuntu using [cloud-init user_data](https://discourse.maas.io/t/customizing-maas-deployments-with-cloud-init/165) or [Curtin preseed data](https://maas.io/docs/custom-node-setup-preseed).
creating-a-custom-ubuntu-image-1652.md:When the [MAAS stream](https://images.maas.io/ephemeral-v3/daily/) is generated by [lp:maas-images](https://launchpad.net/maas-images) it starts by downloading the base SquashFS rootfs from cloud-images.ubuntu.com that is used for all clouds. The SquashFS does not contain a kernel so [lp:maas-images](https://launchpad.net/maas-images) mounts the SquashFS with an overlay and chroots in. It then  installs a kernel and extra initramfs scripts from the cloud-initramfs-rooturl and cloud-initramfs-copymods packages to allow network booting. Once everything is installed the kernel and newly generated initramfs are pulled out of the overlay and everything is unmounted. [lp:maas-images](https://launchpad.net/maas-images) provides the unmodified SquashFS, installed kernel, and generated initramfs as separate files on images.maas.io.

custom-machine-setup-824.md:During machine [enlistment](/t/add-machines/821#heading--enlistment), [deployment](/t/deploy-machines/825), [commissioning](/t/commission-machines/822) and machine installation, MAAS sends [Tempita-derived](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ravenac95/tempita/master/docs/index.txt) configuration files to the [cloud-init](https://launchpad.net/cloud-init) process running on the target machine. MAAS refers to this process as **preseeding**.These preseed files are used to configure a machine's ephemeral and installation environments and can be modified or augmented to a custom machine configuration.
custom-machine-setup-824.md:1.  [Curtin](https://launchpad.net/curtin), a preseeding system similar to Kickstart or d-i (Debian Installer), applies customisations during operating system (OS) image installation. MAAS performs these changes on deployment, during OS installation, but before the machine reboots into the installed OS. Curtin customisations are perfect for administrators who want their deployments to have identical setups all the time, every time. [This blog post](https://blog.ubuntu.com/2017/06/02/customising-maas-installs) contains an excellent high-level overview of custom MAAS installs using Curtin.
custom-machine-setup-824.md:2.  [Cloud-init](https://launchpad.net/cloud-init), a system for setting up machines immediately after instantiation. Curtin applies customisations after the first boot, when MAAS changes a machine's status to 'Deployed.' Customisations are per-instances, meaning that user-supplied scripts must be re-specified on redeployment. Cloud-init customisations are the best way for MAAS users to customise their deployments, similar to how the various cloud services prepare VMs when launching instances.
custom-machine-setup-824.md:The [Tempita](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ravenac95/tempita/master/docs/index.txt) template files are found within the `/etc/maas/preseeds/` directory on the region controller. Each template uses a filename prefix that corresponds to a particular phase of MAAS machine deployment:
custom-machine-setup-824.md:|  3\. Installation | curtin ([Curtin](https://launchpad.net/curtin)) |
custom-machine-setup-824.md:  signal: ["wget", "--no-proxy", "http://example.com/", "--post-data", "system_id=&signal=starting_install", "-O", "/dev/null"]
deploy-machines-825.md:The agent that triggers deployment may vary. For instance, if the machines are destined to run complex, inter-related services that scale up or down frequently, like a "cloud" resource, then [Juju](https://jujucharms.com/docs/stable/about-juju) is the recommended deployment agent. Juju will also install and configure services on the deployed machines. If you want to use MAAS to install a base operating system and work on the machines manually, then you can deploy a machine directly with MAAS.
deploy-machines-825.md:Acquiring ("allocating") a machine reserves the machine for the exclusive use of the acquiring process. The machine is no longer available to any other process, including another MAAS instance, or a process such as [Juju](https://jujucharms.com/docs/stable/about-juju).

explore-maas-787.md:We recommend testing MAAS with [libvirt](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/virtualization-libvirt) and its VM/QEMU hypervisor driver. The majority of Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, support this tool. It is easy to install</a>, and MAAS natively supports power management of VMs created in libvirt. We also recommend that you install the GUI-based `virt-manager` to ease configuration, but you can use `libvirt` from the command line.
explore-maas-787.md:MAAS also works in a Linux virtual machine running from Oracle’s [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org).  VirtualBox may be useful if you want to test MAAS from a Microsoft Windows or macOS environment.
explore-maas-787.md:[Snaps](https://snapcraft.io/docs) are containerised software packages. To install MAAS from a snap simply enter the following:

explore-maas-787.md:Once you have completed this process, you can access the web UI from the default URL (above) and begin your [configuration journey](https://maas.io/docs/configuration-journey).
getting-help-838.md:The best place to get help with your MAAS issue is on the [MAAS Discourse forum](https://discourse.maas.io/). There, you can interact with the MAAS team as well as search for issues similar to your own.
getting-help-838.md:-   [Ask Ubuntu](http://askubuntu.com/questions/ask?tags=maas) web site
getting-help-838.md:-   [Freenode #maas](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=maas) IRC channel
getting-help-838.md:A big step on the way to doing this is by using [sosreport](https://github.com/sosreport/sosreport), an automated information-gathering utility. It is available in the Ubuntu archives:
getting-help-838.md:This will create a tarball containing MAAS log files, MAAS configuration files and a dump of the MAAS database. By default, the tarball will end up in /tmp but you can change the location. See the [sosreport man page](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/search.py?q=sosreport) for details. If there are things you do not wish to share publicly, feel free to edit the tarball.
give-me-an-example-of-maas-1314.md:Assuming you've [installed libvirt](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/libvirt.html) on the machine where you'll be running MAAS, you can create virtual machines like this:
hardening-your-maas-installation-1381.md:Consider setting your [firewall](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/firewall.html#firewall-logs) on your rack and region controllers to disallow communication on all ports except those used by MAAS. For example, assuming you have installed `ufw`, you could execute:
hardening-your-maas-installation-1381.md:One of the best steps you can take to improve both security and availability of your MAAS installation is to install TLS-terminating load balancer.  For MAAS, we recommend using [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.com).  This section explains how to set one up.
hardening-your-maas-installation-1381.md:In the context of MAAS, a [load balancer](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/load-balancing/) distributes the incoming Web UI and API requests across multiple region controllers.  This reduces both load on MAAS and wait times for user requests.  Typically, this is known as a high-availability (HA) configuration, although there are two other [HA configurations](/t/high-availability/804) that can be enabled for MAAS: one for BMC access (for powering on machines), and one for DHCP, which enables primary and secondary DHCP instances that manage the same VLAN.
hardening-your-maas-installation-1381.md:TLS is meant to provide privacy and data integrity between two or more applications.  Privacy is provided by [symmetric cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm), based on a shared secret and uniquely-generated keys negotiated at the start of a session (during the [TLS handshake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#TLS_handshake)).  Identity of each app can be authenticated, though this feature can be optional.  Authenticity of messages is ensured by using [message authentication codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_authentication_code) to detect tampering.
hardening-your-maas-installation-1381.md:Next, in the `defaults` section, add the following lines under `mode http`:
hardening-your-maas-installation-1381.md:    option http-server-close
hardening-your-maas-installation-1381.md:The option `forwardfor` tells HAProxy to add X-Forward-For headers to each request.  The `http-server-close` option reduces latency between HAProxy and your users by closing connections but maintaining a keep-alive.
hardening-your-maas-installation-1381.md:        reqadd X-Forwarded-Proto:\ https
hardening-your-maas-installation-1381.md:Note that you can also [enable HAProxy logging](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-implement-ssl-termination-with-haproxy-on-ubuntu-14-04) if desired.  This logging is an optional feature of the HAProxy tool and is thus left to your discretion.  
hardening-your-maas-installation-1381.md:The Ubuntu firewall, [UFW](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UncomplicatedFirewall), is a front-end for [iptables](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), so the UFW log output is very similar to what you'll encounter in iptables itself.  If you want to secure your MAAS installation, it's very important to periodically review your UFW logs, found in `/var/log/ufw*`.
hardening-your-maas-installation-1381.md:You can also compare attempts on unusual port numbers against [well-known hacker tools](http://www.relevanttechnologies.com/resources_4.asp).  For instance, repeated attempts against port 12361 might mean that someone is attempting to attack with the Whack-a-mole exploit.
hardening-your-maas-installation-1381.md:Review the IP addresses that are being rejected and dropped.  Try to identify them with a `ping -a <IP address>`.  Spoofed addresses won't have an owner (and you can block them).  Real addresses have a [whois](http://www.internic.net/whois.html) entry, so it's possible you can contact the ISP to report and resolve this issue.

high-availability-804.md:MAAS stores all state information in the PostgreSQL database. It is therefore recommended to run it in HA mode. Configuring HA for PostgreSQL is external to MAAS. You will, therefore, need to study the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/high-availability.html) and implement the variant of HA that makes you feel most comfortable.
high-availability-804.md:You can add load balancing with [HAProxy](http://www.haproxy.org/) load-balancing software to support multiple API servers. In this setup, HAProxy provides access to the MAAS web UI and API.
high-availability-804.md:Configure each API server's load balancer by copying the following into `/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg` (see the [upstream configuration manual](http://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/1.6/configuration.html) as a reference). Replace $PRIMARY_API_SERVER_IP and $SECONDARY_API_SERVER_IP with their respective IP addresses:

introduction-to-controllers-786.md:For example, let's say that your [hospital](https://maas.io/docs/maas-example-config) has three key functions: Patient management, Accounting, and Facilities, each on their own VLAN.  Let's say that there are some situations in which you need to share data between all three of these functions.  To accomplish this, you can create a fabric that joins these three VLANS.  Since this fabric just makes it possible for these VLANs to communicate, you can manage the cross-VLAN access with additional software, or permissions, depending on your application software architecture.
introduction-to-machines-829.md:The rest of the cards on the Machine summary are either self-explanatory, or they're covered in the sections below.  The main point is this: You can see that nearly everything about machines takes place within the main menu's "Machines" option.  Incidentally, you can learn more about testing by visiting the [Hardware testing](https://maas.io/docs/hardware-testing) page.

maas-tags-834.md:Because [Juju](https://jujucharms.com/docs/stable/about-juju.html) is the recommended way to deploy services on machines managed by MAAS (see [below](#heading--tag-management)), it supports MAAS tags for application deployments. By specifying MAAS tags as Juju "constraints", services can be deployed to machines that have particular user-defined characteristics.
maas-tags-834.md:A *tag definition* is the criteria by which machines are auto-labelled by the corresponding tag. During machine enlistment, MAAS collects hardware information (using the [lshw](http://ezix.org/project/wiki/HardwareLiSter) utility). The definition used in creating a tag is then constructed using an *XPath expression* based on that information. See [w3schools documentation](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_intro.asp) for details on XPath.
managing-dhcp-759.md:When MAAS manages DHCP, you customise it through the use of DHCP snippets. These are user-defined configuration options that can be applied either globally, per subnet, or per machine. You apply a global snippet to all VLANs, subnets, and machines. All three types end up in `/var/lib/maas/dhcpd.conf` or `/var/lib/maas/dhcpd6.conf`. For information on what options to use, refer to the [`dhcpd.conf` man page](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/search.py?q=dhcpd.conf).
managing-stp-765.md:To alleviate this problem, you should enable [Portfast](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4000/8-2glx/configuration/guide/stp_enha.html#wp1019873) for Cisco switches or its equivalent on other vendor equipment, which allows the ports to come up almost immediately.
ntp-services-762.md:MAAS provides managed NTP services (with [Chrony](https://chrony.tuxfamily.org/)) for all region and rack controllers. This arrangement allows MAAS to both keep its controllers synchronised, and keep deployed machines synchronised as well. You can configure NTP on the 'Network services' tab of the 'Settings' page.

postgresql-ha-hot-standby-803.md:**Disclaimer: These *notes* give an idea of what is involved in setting up 'hot standby' HA mode in PostgreSQL. The below procedures are not regularly tested. Please use the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/high-availability.html) when setting up HA on PostgreSQL.**
power-management-830.md:To manage a machine, MAAS must be able to power cycle it, usually through the machine's [BMC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_Platform_Management_Interface#Baseboard_management_controller) card.  Until you configure the power type, a newly-added machine can't be enlisted and used by MAAS.
prometheus-metrics-813.md:MAAS services can provide [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) endpoints for collecting performance metrics.  These include:
prometheus-metrics-813.md:Once the `/metrics` endpoint is available in MAAS services, Prometheus can be configured to scrape metric values from these. You can configure this by adding a stanza like the following to the [prometheus configuration](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/):
prometheus-metrics-813.md:[Grafana](https://grafana.com/) and Prometheus can be easily deployed using [Juju](https://jujucharms.com/).

Try running a browser (even a text mode one like `elinks`) on the same box as the MAAS server and navigating to the page. If that doesn't work, try `http://127.0.0.1:5240/MAAS/`, which will always point at the local server.
troubleshooting-837.md:Ephemeral images are used by MAAS to boot nodes during commissioning, as well as during deployment. By design, these images are not built to be edited or tampered with, instead they're used to probe the hardware and launch [cloud-init](https://launchpad.net/cloud-init).

upgrade-from-1-9-to-2-x-778.md:Upgrading from 1.9 to 2.3 will therefore involve upgrading the version of Ubuntu to 16.04 LTS. In so doing, the MAAS database and MAAS configuration will be migrated. See the [Xenial Release Notes](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XenialXerus/ReleaseNotes#Upgrading_from_Ubuntu_14.04_LTS_or_15.10) for upgrading to Xenial.
upgrade-from-1-9-to-2-x-778.md:MAAS 1.9 allows users to configure their managed networks to use either [static](https://docs.ubuntu.com/maas/1.9/en/nodes-commission) or dynamic ranges. A static range is used by MAAS to allocate automatic (static) IP addresses while a dynamic range is used solely for DHCP.
upgrading-maas-779.md:See the [Releases](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases) section on the Ubuntu wiki for more information about the Ubuntu release schedule.
user-accounts-790.md:Before a user can deploy a machine, they must import at least one public SSH key into MAAS. This key allows the user to access the deployed machine. The user must possess the corresponding private key. See [Public key authentication](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/public-key-authentication) (ssh.com) if you're not familiar with SSH keys.
user-accounts-790.md:Public keys residing on either [Launchpad](https://help.launchpad.net/YourAccount) or [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/) can also be added. Select either from the 'Source' menu and specify the user ID associated with the key(s). Press the 'Import' button to add any keys MAAS discovers to the current user's MAAS account.
user-accounts-790.md:The user preferences page includes an API key for the currently active user. This key can be copied and regenerated as needed. The API key is used to login to the API from the [MAAS CLI](/t/maas-cli/802). Other services connecting to MAAS such as [Juju](https://jujucharms.com/docs/stable/clouds-maas) will also need this key.
vm-host-networking-1526.md:It is also possible to use [libvirt](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/virtualization-libvirt) to configure a virtual bridge.  This method will also work for LXD VM hosts running on Ubuntu.  Be aware that other methods may be required if you are configuring LXD on an OS other than Ubuntu.
vm-host-storage-pools-1525.md:"Storage pools” are storage resources managed by a VM host. A storage pool is a given amount of storage set aside for use by VMs. A pool can be organized into storage volumes, assigned to VMs as individual block devices. More information is available for both [libvirt](https://libvirt.org/storage.html) and [LXD](https://lxd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/storage/) storage pools.
vmware-images-753.md:MAAS 2.5 and above can deploy VMware ESXi as a custom image. MAAS cannot directly deploy the VMware ESXi ISO; you must create a specialised image from an official VMWare ISO. Canonical created a [packer](https://www.packer.io/) template to automate the image creation process.

vmware-images-753.md:The image may be customized by modifying packer-maas/vmware-esxi/http/vmware-esxi-ks.cfg see Installation and Upgrade Scripts in the [VMware ESXi installation and Setup manual](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/vsphere-esxi-67-installation-setup-guide.pdf) for more information.
vmware-images-753.md:VMware has [very specific hardware requirements](https://www.vmware.com/resources/compatibility/search.php). In particular, running VMware ESXi is not supported in a virtual machine or MAAS virsh Pod.

whats-new-in-maas-2-7-1306.md:A number of bug fixes (see the [list in Launchpad](https://bugs.launchpad.net/maas/+bugs?field.milestone%3Alist=87757&field.milestone%3Alist=89662&field.milestone%3Alist=89714&field.milestone%3Alist=89840&field.milestone%3Alist=89954&field.milestone%3Alist=89682&field.status%3Alist=FIXRELEASED)).

whats-new-in-maas-2-8-1655.md:MAAS 2.8 adds the beta capability to use LXD-based VM hosts and virtual machines (VMs), in addition to the [libvirt](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/virtualization-libvirt)-based VM hosts/VMs already available.  These new LXD VM hosts use the same underlying technology as libvirt (QEMU). Unlike libvirt KVMs, though, LXD VMs can be managed without requiring SSH access to the VM host. LXD are remotely accessed via secure HTTP transport, which provides better security for LXD-based VMs. In addition, LXD has a better API, and is part of a much larger constellation of enterprise software, offering a wider range of future features and use cases.
whats-new-in-maas-2-8-1655.md:Among those other changes are persisting UI state for grouping, new grouping options, bookmarkable URLs with filter and search parameters, and many other performance improvements.
